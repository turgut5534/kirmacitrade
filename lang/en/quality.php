This brings with it the export of fresh fruits and vegetables. Our company stands out as a leading company among the companies serving in this sector. Our company, which tries to keep up with the sector by following the sectoral developments and innovations, always keeps customer satisfaction in the first place.</p><br><p>Our company aims to obtain quality products by paying attention to some factors in the process of shipping the products to its customers. These factors can be examined under 3 main headings.</p><br><p>Fresh From The Field</p><br><p>The most important factor that our company pays attention to in the procurement process of the products is that the products are freshly supplied from the field. At this point, the quality of the products is checked before the products are purchased. Products that comply with certain quality standards are collected at the most appropriate time, taking into account factors such as the time until they go to the cold storage.</p><br><p>In normal times, when buying fruits and vegetables from the grocery store or the market, the most important thing is the freshness of the products. The necessity of freshness of the products gains more importance as the export process is a long process. Our company can obtain much better quality products thanks to the extra sensitivity it shows in this regard.</p><br><p>Packaging in Facilities</p><br><p>Fruits or vegetables supplied fresh from the field are brought to our company's facilities after this process. These products, which are brought for packaging in the facilities, are passed through many processes in the facilities. First of all, products that are damaged or not in good condition are separated from the products. Then the remaining products are classified according to a number of factors such as size and quality. In the packaging of the classified products, hygiene and durability are the most important factors. The products that will travel thousands of kilometers must be packaged in a way that does not cause any damage.</p><br><p>During all these operations carried out in the facilities of our company, all the technological opportunities in the sector are used. Thanks to these technologies, it is ensured that the products are packaged in the best and fastest way and sent to cold storages to wait for their exports. Thanks to the meticulousness of our company at this stage, it ensures that the products that are packaged in hygienic environments, are the freshest and separated according to their sizes. These transactions are among the criteria that our company attaches importance to and has adopted as a principle within the framework of the understanding of providing quality service.</p><br><p>Storage in Hygienic Cold Storage</p><br><p>As a matter of fact, all of the operations applied to the fruits or vegetables to be exported from the field, packaging and storing in the cold storage should be carried out in hygienic environments. However, among these stages, it can be said that the stage where hygiene is most important is the stage of storing the products in the cold storage. Because the products wait much more at the storage stage compared to other stages. Failure to keep the products in hygienic environments during this waiting period seriously reduces the quality of the products. Since quality is the most important element of our company, extra care is taken at this stage.</p><br><p>On the other hand, when we look at the cold storage of our company, we can say that they have warehouses that create the most suitable environments for the products. For example, the ideal temperature of 5 degrees for any product differs in another product. The warm environment for one product may be cold enough for another product to damage the product. Our facilities, which operate at the most suitable temperatures, continue to be protected in the same way until the products are delivered to the places where they request. In this way, it is ensured that even the products that are going to be delivered are delivered in the best quality."
